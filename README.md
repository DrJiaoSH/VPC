# Variation-Pattern-Classification
This repository is created to publish the simulation code for the acticle "Variation Pattern Classification of Function data". See arxiv.org/abs/2004.00855

Comparison.R is for comparison for the three competitor methods (VPC, PJ, FQC), Dependent.R is for the VPC classification of dependent functional data (two FMA(3) processces), and Unbalanced.R is for testing the performance of the VPC under unbalanced sample sizes.
